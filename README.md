# nasa-app

##Personal Project
**Purpose:** Leverage vanilla JavaScript skills (i.e manipulating the DOM) and learn about interacting with public API data. Plus, to appreciate React more :P

**The main idea of the web app**: Users can simply type the date in and the webapp will return the results ("NASA picture of the day") of that date. 
*More features I hope to implement:* 
- Users can add one or more dates to get more results, then compare the interesting pictures at the same time. 
- Users can sign in/ sign out.
- Users can favorite a picture and save it to their Favorites.
- ....
